packed-sign
===========

Sometimes when processing files generated by legacy systems, I come across a certain formatting of number.
These numbers look like regular numbers, until you see the last digit, which is actually a letter (or sometimes '{').
This is because the character holds the sign information as well as a 0-9 value.
I called this "packed sign", but later found out it is more commonly referred to as "Signed Overpunch". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_overpunch
The translation for the last digit is this:

|character|sign|value|
|---------|----|-----|
|{|+|0|
|A|+|1|
|B|+|2|
|C|+|3|
|D|+|4|
|E|+|5|
|F|+|6|
|G|+|7|
|H|+|8|
|I|+|9|
|}|-|0|
|J|-|1|
|K|-|2|
|L|-|3|
|M|-|4|
|N|-|5|
|O|-|6|
|P|-|7|
|Q|-|8|
|R|-|9|


This package contains a NumberFormatter to parse and format these numbers.
