packed-sign
===========

Somtimes when processing files generated by legacy systems, I come accress a certain formatting of number. These numbers look like regular numbers, until you see the last digit, which is actually a letter (or sometimes '{').  This is because the character holds the sign information as well as a 0-9 value.  I dub it "packed sign".  
The translation for the last digit is this:

|character|sign|value|
|---------|----|-----|
|{|+|0|
|A|+|1|
|B|+|2|
|C|+|3|
|D|+|4|
|E|+|5|
|F|+|6|
|G|+|7|
|H|+|8|
|I|+|9|
|}|-|0|
|A|-|1|
|B|-|2|
|C|-|3|
|D|-|4|
|E|-|5|
|F|-|6|
|G|-|7|
|H|-|8|
|I|-|9|


This package contains a NumberFormatter to parse and format these nubmers.
